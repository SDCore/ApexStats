# Apex Stats Bot

The bot now uses Slash Commands. Type `/` and tap the Bots Icon to view a list of commands. This post will be updated once the bot has been fully upgraded to use Slash Commands.

If you're having problems using Slash Commands, reinvite the bot using the [invite link](https://apexstats.dev/invite). There's no need to kick it, just reinvite, add your server, and it'll be good to go. Join the support server if you have any questions.
